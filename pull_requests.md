##  Building Pull Requests

How this works:
	
### 1. Github pull request builder plugin

This plugin does all of the magic, just set it up in Jenkins with a user who has access to your repo. 

### 2. Create a pull request builder job

This prevents your main job being clogged up and spamming everybody.

### 3. Pull request!

See build status in your pull requests.
